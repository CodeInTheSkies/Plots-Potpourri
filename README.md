 ## A Potpourri of Interesting Data Analysis Plots with Brief Explanations
 
 Here I present a growing collection of carefully chosen plots that are interesting in their own right, which have been part of various analysis projects I have been handling recently.
 
 For each plot, I include brief context and explanations.
 
 ### 1. Expressions across cancers â€“ one gene at a time

This plot shows log expressions (box and whisker plots) of selected genes in cancer versus normal tissues. Each dot represents either a healthy individual or a cancer patient depending on the group as shown. The idea behind creating this type of plot is to identify genes that are widely expressed well across multiple cancers but minimally expressed in normal tissues. Such genes can be further chosen as candidates for future drug targets to improve chemotherapy. 

The two genes chosen demonstrate the contrasting scenarios where MAGEA4 turns out to be a good choice (and hence the green check mark), whereas MAGEA8 turns out to be a bad choice since it is expressed in so many normal tissues (hence the cross mark). 

So, one final question that may be on your mind is, "why do we need to make sure the gene is not expressed in normal tissues"?  This is a requirement because the drugs target these genes in the sense that they try to suppress or inhibit these genes from expressing and thereby starve the cancer progression. This is the mechanism of treatment. Therefore, this criteria makes sure that the damaging side effect of chemotherapy, where normal tissues (or cells) are also killed, is kept to the minimum.
