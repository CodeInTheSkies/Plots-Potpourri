 ### A Potpourri of Interesting Data Analysis Plots with Brief Explanations
 
 Here I present a growing collection of carefully chosen plots that are interesting in their own right, which have been part of various analysis projects I have been handling recently.
 
 For each plot, I include brief context and explanations.
 
 #### Expressions across cancers â€“ one gene at a time
 
 ![Log expressions of selected genes in cancer versus normal tissues](/plots/MageA4_vs_MageA8.png)
 
This plot shows log expressions of selected genes in cancer versus normal tissues. Each dot represents either a healthy individual or a cancer patient. The idea of this plot is to identify genes that are widely expressed well across multiple cancers but minimally expressed in normal tissues. Such genes can be further chosen as candidates for future drug targets for chemotherapy.
